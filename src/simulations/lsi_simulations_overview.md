# LSI Simulations Overview

This folder contains simulation scenarios, runners, and outputs for Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure (LSI).

## Structure
- `scenarios/` — specific what-if setups (corridor, users, timing shocks).
- `runners/` — code or pseudo-code showing how to execute scenarios.
- `results/` — captured outputs (CSV, JSON, plots).

Simulations are used to:
- test sequencing behavior under stress,
- observe timing mismatches,
- compare LSI vs. traditional processing,
- evaluate corridor-level liquidity usage.
