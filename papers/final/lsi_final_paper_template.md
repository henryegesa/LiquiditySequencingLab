- Gaps this research fills  

---

## 3. Conceptual Framework: Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure  
- Define LSI  
- Explain sequencing vs. payment vs. settlement  
- Introduce constructs:  
  - Sequencing Graph  
  - Liquidity-Time Curve  
  - Programmable Settlement Window  
  - Flow Optimization Engine  
- Show conceptual diagrams (stored in `/diagrams`)  

---

## 4. Methodology  
Describe final methodology, including:  
- modeling approach  
- equations or algorithms  
- data assumptions  
- simulation logic  
- architecture reference (link to `/src`)  

---

## 5. Results  
- Sequencing efficiency findings  
- Liquidity stress behaviors  
- Cross-border timing improvements  
- Graphs and tables (stored in `/models` or `/diagrams`)  

---

## 6. Discussion  
- Interpret the findings  
- Relate back to the thesis  
- Compare with traditional settlement flows  

---

## 7. Implications  
- Infrastructure design impact  
- Cross-border remittance impact  
- Monetary policy timing effect  
- Systemic risk implications  
- Design principles for future programmable liquidity networks  

---

## 8. Limitations  
Fully transparent limitations of:  
- assumptions  
- modeling scope  
- corridor data  
- simulation constraints  

---

## 9. Future Research  
- Multi-currency LSI modeling  
- Multi-node remittance sequencing  
- Regulator-in-the-loop sequencing  
- Hybrid CBDC–private LSI interactions  

---

## 10. Conclusion  
- Reaffirm the thesis  
- State LSI’s contribution  
- Emphasize timing as the next frontier in monetary infrastructure
