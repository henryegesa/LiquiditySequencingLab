# Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure (LSI)
## Draft Paper Template (Working Draft)

### 1. Title  
Working research title goes here.

---

### 2. Introduction  
- Define the real-world liquidity or timing problem.  
- Identify failures in current systems (payments, remittances, payroll, settlement).  
- State the core research question.  
- End with the thesis statement.

---

### 3. Background & Motivation  
- Why timing matters more than value in modern money movement.  
- Prior work and gaps (BIS, IMF, Fed, cross-border studies).  
- Why sequencing is a missing layer in financial architecture.  

---

### 4. Conceptual Framework  
- Define Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure (LSI).  
- Explain sequencing vs. ordering vs. clearing vs. settlement.  
- Introduce any key constructs:  
  - sequencing graph  
  - liquidity-time curve  
  - programmable settlement window  
  - FOE (Flow Optimization Engine) logic  

---

### 5. Model / System Design  
Describe your technical or analytical approach:  
- mathematical model  
- simulation structure  
- assumptions  
- data sources  
- architecture diagram references (point to `/diagrams` folder)  

---

### 6. Results / Findings  
- High-level findings  
- What behaviors or insights emerged  
- Graphs or tables (store in `/models` or `/diagrams`)  

---

### 7. Implications  
- Infrastructure implications  
- Monetary or policy implications  
- Cross-border settlement implications  
- Risk, liquidity, and timing effects  

---

### 8. Limitations  
Honest assessment of assumptions, constraints, or data limitations.

---

### 9. Future Work  
List refinements: expanded simulations, multi-corridor models, programmable liquidity constraints, etc.

---

### 10. Conclusion  
Restate thesis, summarize contribution, and close the draft.
