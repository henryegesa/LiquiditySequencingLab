# Notes Index

This folder contains all informal thinking, reasoning notes, and quick sketches that support LSI research.

## Structure
- `ideas/` — unrefined concepts, frameworks, hooks, insights.
- `research-notes/` — notes from papers, BIS reports, IMF studies.
- `meeting-notes/` — notes from discussions, planning sessions, feedback.
- `scratch/` — equations, pseudo-code, rough diagrams, experiments.

Use this area for rapid iteration. Finalized outputs move into `/papers`, `/src/models`, or `/src/architecture`.
