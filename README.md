# LiquiditySequencingLab
Research, models, and architectural work for Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure — a systems framework for how money is organized, sequenced, and settled.

This repository houses the research, models, and architectural work behind **Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure (LSI)** — a new architecture for how money is organized, sequenced, and settled.

LSI treats money not just as a balance or a payment event, but as something that can be **sequenced**: ordered, orchestrated, and resolved through a dedicated timing layer. The lab’s work spans theory, frameworks, and early experimental designs for this sequencing layer.

## Purpose

- Formalize **Liquidity Sequencing Infrastructure** as a coherent field of study.  
- Document the conceptual, analytical, and experimental work coming out of the **Liquidity Sequencing Lab**.  
- Provide a structured home for papers, frameworks, models, and lab notes that explore how monetary systems can be redesigned at the sequencing layer.

## Core Papers

The lab’s research currently centers on four main papers, in this conceptual order:

1. **Rewriting the Geography of Money**  
   Macro-level thesis on why existing monetary architectures are structurally misaligned and why a sequencing layer is needed.

2. **[Three-Pillar Paper Title]**  
   Framework-level articulation of the core pillars that support a programmable liquidity and sequencing architecture.

3. **Harnessing Business Analytics for Predictive Liquidity Insights in Cross-Border Remittance Systems**  
   Analytical work demonstrating how data and predictive methods reveal structural liquidity stresses and timing failures.

4. **Designing a Decision Intelligence Framework for Real-Time Liquidity Allocation in Programmable Payment Networks**  
   Applied architecture for decision intelligence and real-time allocation inside programmable monetary systems.

(PDFs for these papers live in the [`/papers`](./papers) directory.)
